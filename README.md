# Problem-solving
This repository contains solutions of some of the problems I have solved on different platforms across the Internet.
Check out my [Approach to CP in a nutshell](https://github.com/sankalp1999/3rdSem-Data-Structures-Lab#some-thoughts---cp-related) if you have interest in Competitive programming.

A lot of solutions here are those which I would like to review or some which are really good problems.

## Reflection
Emphasis should be on the thinking process.
- Think of some simple logic initially and not apply any algo design technique directly.
- Don't assume difficulty of question initially. If scores are there, then thats good to estimate.
- Focus on thinking for more time.


## Online Tests for internship (Not placement)
This is all luck or I am dumb or maybe just others are better than me(pressure handling, thinking, previous efforts, smartness) who cleared. Anyways, i will keep doing problems as I enjoy solving.

## Mistakes
- Many a times problems have simple solution which does not involve DP, recursion etc. Implementation adn greedy are the way to go for this practice.
- Not reading full question or constraints
- Panicking
- Changing approach fast when some more checking can help get AC. This is basically hurrying. Try to stick longer and work out on paper.
- Do not get disheartened by failures/not being able to solve. No need to rant. Analyse your mistakes and move forward
- Don't run away from stuff you don't like/ basic difficult stuff. You will have to cover them sometime. 

## Resources

I had written this long post somewhere else but this is a better place.
All the good YouTube channels for Competitive Programming(not coding interview) I know are-

[Youtube Channels for CP and CI](YoutubeChannels.md)



## A small post/article
[Meta Coding Interview Style Problem Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cl0PZh6MQcb9XgcmiBkUXcoY7ahi7hO5sSRqwfU16Mc/edit#) - I had written this for a friend. Might help you also.
