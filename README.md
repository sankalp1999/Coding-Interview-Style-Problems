# Problem-solving
This repository contains solutions of some of the problems I have solved on different platforms across the Internet.
Check out my [Approach to CP in a nutshell](https://github.com/sankalp1999/3rdSem-Data-Structures-Lab#some-thoughts---cp-related) if you have interest in Competitive programming.

A lot of solutions here are those which I would like to review or some which are really good problems.

### Points to keep in mind always
- Constantly, push throughout your comfort zone. It's recursive.
- Read the problem statement and constraints carefully. 
- Don't panic, giveup, rush.
- Work on a paper. Thinking is better on paper.
- No need to stress. Play.

## Reflection
Emphasis should be on the thinking process.
- Focus on thinking for more time. Try to code after you are clear with the algorithm/logic. Try getting ACs in min. attempts during practice 
  Debug it if you think it's correct or if it is passing some later
test cases. Don't change approach abruptly.
- Think of some simple logic i.e from scratch initially and not apply any algo design technique directly. When you think from scratch, your previous experience might also help in solving. Later, you can apply other logic and patterns after sometime if implementation does not work. Basically, narrowing down after sometime.
- Don't assume difficulty of question initially. If scores are there, then thats good to estimate.
- Deep breaths or small breaks (1 - 2 minutes) can help.




## Mistakes (2020)
- Many a times problems have simple solution which does not involve DP, recursion etc. Implementation and greedy are the way to go for this practice.
- Not reading full question or constraints
- Panicking
- Changing approach fast when some more checking can help get AC. This is basically hurrying. Try to stick longer and work out on paper.
- Do not get disheartened by failures/not being able to solve. No need to rant. Analyse your mistakes and move forward
- Don't run away from stuff you don't like/ basic difficult stuff. You will have to cover them sometime. 

## Resources

I had written this long post somewhere else but this is a better place.
All the good YouTube channels for Competitive Programming(not coding interview) I know are-

[Youtube Channels for CP and CI](YoutubeChannels.md)

## A small post/article
[Meta Coding Interview Style Problem Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cl0PZh6MQcb9XgcmiBkUXcoY7ahi7hO5sSRqwfU16Mc/edit#) - I had written this for a friend. Might help you also.
