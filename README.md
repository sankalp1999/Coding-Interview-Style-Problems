# Problem-solving
This repository contains solutions of some of the problems I have solved on different platforms across the Internet.
A lot of solutions are those which I would like to review or some which are really good problems.


## Reflection
- Think of some simple logic initially and not apply any algo design technique directly.
- Don't assume difficulty of question initially. If scores are there, then thats good to estimate.
- Focus on thinking for more time.


## Online Tests for internship (Not placement)
7th August
I have solved a lot of questions on LC/IB and have missed two OTs by offbyone errors/changing approach and MSFT by not reading constrains properly and panicking.

- Sleep well.
- Very uncertain. Could be very standard questions or could be weird questions not remotely similar to LC/IB
- Sometimes, they may be simple implementation/ thinking problem. 
- Luck plays a huge factor. Someone getting through might not be very superior to you.
- Competitive programming helps more in clearing OT. recommended to do some sort of problem solving questions before interview prep. Linkedlist, trees 
  mostly will not appear in online assessment

## Mistakes
- Many a times problems have simple solution which does not involve DP, recursion etc. Implementation adn greedy are the way to go for this practice.
- Not reading full question or constraints
- Panicking
- Changing approach fast when some more checking can help get AC
- Do not get disheartened by failures/not being able to solve. No need to rant. Analyse your mistakes and move forward
- Don't run away from stuff you don't like/ basic difficult stuff. You will have to cover them sometime. 



## Resources

I had written this long post somewhere else but this is a better place.
All the good YouTube channels for Competitive Programming(not coding interview) I know are-

[Youtube Channels for CP and CI](YoutubeChannels.md)
