# Problem-solving
This repository contains solutions of some of the problems I have solved on different platforms across the Internet.
A lot of solutions are those which I would like to review or some which are really good problems.


## Reflection
- Think of some simple logic initially and not apply any algo design technique directly.
- Don't assume difficulty of question initially. If scores are there, then thats good to estimate.
- Focus on thinking for more time.

## Mistakes
- Many a times problems have simple solution which does not involve DP, recursion etc. Implementation adn greedy are the way to go for this practice.
- Not reading full question or constraints
- Panicking
- Changing approach fast when some more checking can help get AC
- Do not get disheartened by failures/not being able to solve. No need to rant. Analyse your mistakes and move forward
- Don't run away from stuff you don't like/ basic difficult stuff. You will have to cover them sometime.

I had written this long post somewhere else but this is a better place.
All the good YouTube channels for Competitive Programming(not coding interview) I know are-
