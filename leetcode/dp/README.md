### LCS
- Longest Palindromic Subsequence, with a reverse string (LPS). 
- Minimum number of deletions or insertions to convert to palindrome - Use LPS and n - x is the answer. Length of LPS is inversely proportional to number of 
  deletions. check [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFwCCNbRuLY&list=PL_z_8CaSLPWekqhdCPmFohncHwz8TY2Go&index=28)
- Shortest Common Supersequence. Again find LCS and then merge strings accordingly.

### LIS
- LIS 
- Maximum sum increasing subsequence

### MCM
- MCM
- Egg drop solve(e - 1, k -  1) Go down since egg broke, solve(e, f - k) egg didnt break. Try from above. Better solution is their with binary search.
