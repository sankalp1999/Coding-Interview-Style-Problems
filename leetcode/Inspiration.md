### Be true to yourself about how much you know and don't know


- I was at your position some 4-5 months ago. I could hardly solve medium ones and could mostly solve one question in contests. The only thing I did was practice and practice. 
Be true to yourself, about what you know and what you don't. Watch youtube tutorials, Kevin, Nick, TechDose. Thsey have very good content. 
I relaly benefitted from them a lot. Now I can solve most of the times 3 questions in contests, many medium questions. Practice and consistency is the key.

- Set 1 hour time.
- I try around 2-3 hour at max. After that, solution and explanation. Basically, keep trying till i am getting some ideas. The CP way

I recently got an offer from Morgan Stanley as Software Engineer, 2 more fulltime offers andone internship offer. 
(Mentioned these just so that you can feel that whatever I said can be followed and is credible).
