Wow, didn't expect this.

The list just confirms that beginners should focus on general problem-solving techniques rather than these complex (or even intermediate topics).

Problem-solving heuristics that are actually very important, (From Arthur Engel's Problem-Solving Strategies plus additional resources),

Invariants
Monovariants (increasing/decreasing)
Coloring(cycles/modulo)
Extremal principle
Pigeonhole principle
Enumerative Combinatorics, graph theory
Number theory
Inequalities
Induction
Sequences, Polynomials, Games
Algebra
Problem reduction, Identifying subproblems
Pattern Observation, trying some examples(Getting your hands dirty)
Working Backwards
Exchange Arguments
Draw a picture
Convenient Notation
Guessing
Symmetry
Wishful thinking (What is about the problem that makes it hard?)
Penultimate step(What will yield the solution in a single step)
Polya's mouse(quickly trying all these techniques above really fast, not getting stuck on one approach)
The first step in most of the competitive programming problems is usually these heuristics rather than the algorithms themselves, which usually reveal themselves after you have progressed using these heuristics above.

ecnerwala also mentioned that in a very difficult problem, there are more than 4 or 5 crucial pieces of information given. The ability to choose what information should be generalized and abstracted out, and which information should not, is important for speed, and it comes only with practice.

Another learning from tourist streams was, he never gets stuck in one approach, and he quickly tries all these approaches in a very short amount of time. I have found it very difficult to even let go of one thought process, once I have gone deep enough. The brain tricks you over and over again not to start from scratch, and you keep retrying that old approach.

Also, if you don't generalize and map those problems to these types of heuristics, every problem will look ad-hoc, and you would not be able to reduce one problem to another.
