## Linked Lists
The main idea in linkedlists questions 
1. Figure out till where to traverse.
2. Which links to make and break
3. Figure out if a link needs to be saved in a temporary variable
4. Slow pointer and fast pointer
5. Whether one needs a temporary head or not

### Good problems
- Reverse nodes in k groups
- Floyd Algorithm
- Merge Two Sorted Lists
- Swap Adjacent Node Pairs (temporary head and saving links)
