- Think in terms of sorting, priority queue
- Starting time , end times
- Be careful in disjoint interval(Sort according to earliest finish times and then, use priority queue to store the overlapping intervals. 
, max-interval point(priority queue/sort with separate arrays), minimum rooms to schedule(priority queue)
- Some problems are difficult while some are easy implementation like the Bulbs problem where to follow an invariant (go in a certain order like left to right)
